Upon submission, users receive an acknowledgment alert, confirming that their comment has been received. This interactive feature fosters a sense of community and engagement among users, allowing them to connect with the organization behind the application.

Overall, the Endangered Species Information web application serves as an educational resource, promoting the importance of wildlife conservation while empowering users to take part in meaningful actions to protect endangered species. Its thoughtful design, combined with a wealth of information, makes it an invaluable tool for raising awareness about the critical state of global biodiversity.
